The high revenue from Malaria and Cold & Flu suggests these are common ailments with high treatment frequency or high unit costs in these regions.
The Inpatient department incurs the highest pharmacy costs, followed closely by Emergency. The Outpatient department has the lowest relative cost among the three.
